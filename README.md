# Comp-rs
Collection of competative programming solutions (in rust) along with a template file with a macro to help with input
All of these are compiled with `rustc 1.49.0` but mostly they are just submitted to [codeforces](https://codeforces.com) or [CSES](https://cses.fi) (maybe some others later, idk)
